    Automatically configures a test case for recording or playback and
    giving it a tapedeck attribute.

    Calls will be placed into different channels which allows the recording
    file to contain multiple call streams.  This allows multiple unit
    tests in a test case to share the same recording file.  This technique
    is compatible with distributed test harnesses like pytest-xdist as
    long as all the tests in a test case are executed together.

    Use the @recorded decorator to make it easy to patch things for recording.

    When the environment variable RECORDING is set, the tests in this test
    class will record what they do.  When the environment variable is not
    set, the tests run in playback mode.

    NOTDONE (and maybe not necessary):
    When the environment variable RECORDING_KEY is set, the recording is
    encrypted and decrypted using the given key.  This is optional depending
    on whether the recording has secrets in it.  When dealing with third party
    packages that use tokens, they usually do.
